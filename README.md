Thesaurus is a ~~simple~~ _elementary_ and ~~fast~~ _expeditious_ CLI for all
of your ~~wordy~~ _pleonastic_ needs. It supports compound words (for example,
"good day") and even supports ~~sepllcheking~~ spellchecking!

### Installation

Thesaurus requires python 3 and can be installed either through
[pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

`$ pip3 install cli-thesaurus` or `$ brew install cli-thesaurus`

This tool was inspired by other ~~discontinued~~ _antediluvian_
works[\[1\]](https://github.com/davidgu/thesaurus-cli)[\[2\]](https://github.com/empireshades/command-line-thesaurus).
